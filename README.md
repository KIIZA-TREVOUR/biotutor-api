# BioTutor API

> **ALX Backend Engineering Capstone Project**  
> A RESTful API for managing biology education content aligned with Uganda's secondary school curriculum.

## üå± Overview

This project provides a structured backend for teachers to create and manage biology lessons, while students can securely access published content. It serves as the foundation for **BioTutor**, a future AI-powered educational platform for Ugandan students.

Built with **Django 4.2**, **Django REST Framework**, and **SQLite** (for development), this API follows REST conventions, role-based permissions, and clean URL design.

---

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented (As of Week 3)

### üîê Authentication
- JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- User registration for both teachers and students
- Secure login endpoint
- Token-based authorization for protected routes

### üë• User Management
- Custom `User` model with:
  - `role` (`teacher` or `student`)
  - `school` (e.g., "Kibuli SS")
  - `bio` (optional teacher bio)
  - Email validation
- Role-based permissions system
- Fully integrated with Django Admin

### üìö Content Models
- **`Category`**: Biology topics (e.g., "Cells", "Ecology")
  - Fields: `name`, `slug`, `description`, `created_at`
- **`BiologyContent`**: Full lessons/notes
  - Fields: `title`, `slug`, `summary`, `content_body`, `is_published`, `author`, `category`
  - Linked to `User` (author) and `Category`

### üåê RESTful API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Permissions |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `/api/auth/register/` | `POST` | Register new user (teacher/student) | Public |
| `/api/auth/login/` | `POST` | Get JWT token | Any active user |
| `/api/categories/` | `GET` | List all categories | Public |
| `/api/categories/{id}/` | `GET` | Retrieve one category | Public |
| `/api/categories/{id}/content/` | `GET` | List content in category | Public (published only) |
| `/api/content/` | `GET` | List content | Students: published only<br>Teachers: their own content |
| `/api/content/` | `POST` | Create new content | **Teachers only** |
| `/api/content/{id}/` | `GET` | Retrieve content | Public (published) / Teacher (own drafts) |
| `/api/content/{id}/` | `PUT`/`PATCH` | Update content | **Author only** |
| `/api/content/{id}/` | `DELETE` | Delete content | **Author only** |

### üîç Advanced Features
- **Filtering**:  
  - `?category=1` - Filter by category ID
  - `?author=1` - Filter by author ID
  - `?category__slug=cell-biology` - Filter by category slug
- **Search**:  
  `?search=mitochondria` (searches `title` and `content_body`)
- **Pagination & Ordering**:  
  Default: newest first (`?ordering=-created_at`)

### üîí Security & Permissions
- `IsTeacher`: Only teachers can create/edit content
- `IsAuthor`: Only the content author can update/delete
- Students **cannot** see unpublished (`is_published=False`) content
- JWT token expiration and refresh mechanism
- Password hashing with Django's built-in security

## üìù Using the API with Different Tools

### Using cURL

```bash
# Register a teacher
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/register/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"teacher1","email":"trevour@biotutor.com","password":"trevour256","role":"teacher"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"teacher1","password":"trevour256"}'

# Get all categories
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/categories/

# Create content (replace YOUR_TOKEN with actual token)
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/content/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test Lesson","slug":"test-lesson","summary":"Test summary","content_body":"Test content","category":1,"is_published":true}'
```

---

### Using Postman

1. **Import requests** as a Postman collection
2. **Create environment variable** named `access_token`
3. **Login first** (Step 3 or 4) and copy the `access` token from response
4. **Set the variable**: Paste token into `access_token` environment variable
5. **Use in requests**: Add `{{access_token}}` in Authorization header as "Bearer Token"

**Setting up Authorization in Postman:**
- Go to the Authorization tab
- Select Type: "Bearer Token"
- Token: `{{access_token}}`

---

### Using Python Requests

```python
import requests

BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"

# 1. Register a teacher
register_data = {
    "username": "teacher1",
    "email": "trevour@biotutor.com",
    "password": "trevour256",
    "role": "teacher"
}
response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/api/auth/register/", json=register_data)
print("Registration:", response.json())

# 2. Login
login_data = {
    "username": "teacher1",
    "password": "trevour256"
}
response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/api/auth/login/", json=login_data)
tokens = response.json()
access_token = tokens['access']
print("Access Token:", access_token)

# 3. Set up headers with token
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# 4. Get all categories
response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/api/categories/")
print("Categories:", response.json())

# 5. Create new content
content_data = {
    "title": "Photosynthesis Process",
    "slug": "photosynthesis-process",
    "summary": "Overview of photosynthesis in plants",
    "content_body": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy...",
    "category": 1,
    "is_published": True
}
response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/api/content/", json=content_data, headers=headers)
print("New Content:", response.json())

# 6. Get all content
response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/api/content/", headers=headers)
print("All Content:", response.json())

# 7. Search content
response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/api/content/?search=photosynthesis")
print("Search Results:", response.json())
```

---

### Using JavaScript (Fetch API)

```javascript
const BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000";

// Login and get token
async function login() {
  const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/api/auth/login/`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      username: 'teacher1',
      password: 'trevour256'
    })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.access;
}

// Create content
async function createContent(token) {
  const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/api/content/`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      title: 'Cell Division',
      slug: 'cell-division',
      summary: 'Overview of mitosis and meiosis',
      content_body: 'Cell division is the process by which cells reproduce...',
      category: 1,
      is_published: true
    })
  });
  return await response.json();
}

// Use the functions
(async () => {
  const token = await login();
  console.log('Token:', token);
  
  const content = await createContent(token);
  console.log('Created Content:', content);
})();
```

## üêõ Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid token" error
**Solution:** 
- Ensure token is not expired
- Check that you're using the `access` token, not `refresh`
- Verify Authorization header format: `Bearer <token>`

### Issue: "Permission denied" when creating content
**Solution:**
- Verify user has `role='teacher'`
- Check that token is valid and not expired
- Ensure Authorization header is included

### Issue: Cannot see unpublished content
**Solution:**
- Unpublished content is only visible to:
  - The author (teacher who created it)
  - Not visible to students or other teachers
